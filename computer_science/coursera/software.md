## Introduction to software

### What is software?

* software terms
    1. coding : translating one language to another
    2. Scripting : coding in a scripting language
        * scripting language : mainly used to perform a single or limited range task.
    3. programming : coding in a programming language
        * programming language : special languages that software developers use to write instructions for computers to execute
    
### Types of software
* Commercial vs non-commercial software
    1. commercial - licence 구입
    2. non-commercial - making it open source 
        * developers will let other developers share, modify, and distribute their software for free.

* software that is categorized by function
    1. application software : fulfill a specific need - text editor, web browser, graphics editor...
    2. system software : used to keep our core system running - OS tools and utilities
    3. Firmware : Permanently stored on a computer component (BIOS)

* software versions 
    * versions are tell us what features were added to a specific software iteration
    * [What is iteration?](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/iteration)
    * In agile software development, an iteration is a single development cycle, usually measured as one week or two weeks. An iteration may also be defined as the elapsed time between iteration planning sessions. 
    * elapsed time : amount of time that passes from the start of an event to its finish.
    * standard that distinguish a version : sequential numbering trend. 
        * 1.2.4 -> 1.3.4
        

* agile software development (애자일 방법론)
    * [애자일 소프트웨어 개발](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%95%A0%EC%9E%90%EC%9D%BC_%EC%86%8C%ED%94%84%ED%8A%B8%EC%9B%A8%EC%96%B4_%EA%B0%9C%EB%B0%9C)
    * 프로젝트의 생명주기동안 반복적인 개발을 촉진한다.
    * 소프트웨어 개발 방법론에 있어서, 아무런 계획이 없는 방법론 vs 지나치게 디테일한 개발 방법론 사이의 타협점 (계획이 없는 -> 미래에 대한 예측이 힘듦, 지나치게 디테일한 -> 형식적 절차를 따르는 데 필요한 시간 & 비용 + 개발 흐름 자체를 느리게함)
    * less document-oriented, more code-oriented
    * 예측하며 개발 X -> 일정한 주기를 가지고 끊임없이 프로토타입을 만들어냄.
